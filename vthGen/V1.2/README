1. The file 'test.m’ is the testench,
2. The file ‘VT.m’ is the main function to generate the variation map, 
3. The file ‘correlation.m’ is the correlation function,
4. The file ’visualization.m’ is to visualize the variation map. 
5. There are two figures of the variation maps of 100x100 size in the folder ‘Spatial Correlation Generator)


Problem remains to be solved: 
the systematic variation is not symmetrical.
